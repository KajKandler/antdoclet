Example from FuegoBPM
----------------------

AntDoclet was started as an effort to document the Ant tasks provided
by the FuegoBPM product (now BEA's AquaLogic BPM):

 * [FuegoBPM tasks reference doc in HTML](http://edocs.bea.com/albsi/docs55/antlib/index.html)
 * [FuegoBPM tasks reference doc in PDF](http://edocs.bea.com/albsi/docs55/pdfs/Fuego55-Ant.pdf)



Example from Ant Core tasks 
---------------------------

I run AntDoclet over the source code of the actual Ant Core tasks, and here's
the result.

Since these tasks' source code is _not_
"AntDoclet-aware" (not all @tags are used, invalid HTML in comments,
etc) the result is far from perfect, specially on the LaTeX/PDF output.
