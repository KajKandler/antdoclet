Example from Oracle BPM (formerly FuegoBPM)
----------------------

AntDoclet was started as an effort to document the Ant tasks provided
by the Fuego BPM product (now Oracle BPM):

 * \[HTML\] [Oracle BPM 10.3 tasks reference](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E13154_01/bpm/docs65/anttasks/index.html)
 * \[PDF\] [Fuego BPM 5.5 tasks reference](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E13165_01/albsi/docs55/pdfs/Fuego55-Ant.pdf)


Example from Ant Core tasks 
---------------------------

I run AntDoclet over the source code of the standard core Ant tasks, and here's the
result.

Since the source code of these tasks is _not_
"AntDoclet-aware" (not all @tags are used, there's invalid HTML in comments,
etc) the result is far from perfect, specially on the LaTeX/PDF output.

 * \[HTML\] [Core Ant tasks reference](html/index.html)
 * \[PDF\] [Core Ant tasks reference](pdf/anttasks-manual.pdf)
