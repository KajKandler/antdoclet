Example output from Antdoclet
-----------------------------

Instead of showing a toy example, I decided to run AntDoclet over
the source code of the actual Ant Core tasks themselves.

Since these tasks' source code is _not_
"AntDoclet-aware" (not all @tags are used, invalid HTML in comments,
etc) the result is far from perfect, specially on the LaTeX/PDF output.
If you follow AntDoclet conventions in your own Ant tasks, the
generated output will be better than this example:</p>

 * [Core Ant tasks reference doc in HTML](html/index.html)
 * [Core Ant tasks reference doc in PDF](pdf/anttasks-manual.pdf)
